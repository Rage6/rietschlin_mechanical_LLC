This was my first website for a client, a local business in Ohio called Rietschlin Mechanical, LLC. 
<ul>
  <li>As a relatively simple website with no need to display a collection of data, I used a "one-page" design for this website.</li>
  <li>
    This was also my first use of basic animation and an early practice of the preprocessor, SASS.
  </li>
  <li>
    My client still needs to provide me a few particular photos, so some of the current images are on twice.
  </li>
</ul>
