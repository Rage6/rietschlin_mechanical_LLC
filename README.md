This was my first website for a business, Rietschlin Mechanical LLC, which is a small, local business in rural Ohio. 
<ul>
  <li>As a relatively simple website with no need to display a collection of data, I used a "one-page" design for this website.</li>
  <li>
    This was also my first use of basic animation. The images that alternate at the top of the page utilizes "keyframes" in my CSS and Sass. The rapid slide from the top of the page down to the desired top after a user clicks on a menu option is carried out by my Javascript and jQuery design.
  </li>
  <li>
    Using @media queries, I was able to adapt my client's page so that it can accomodate a large span of screen widths.
  </li>
  <li>
    My client still needs to provide me a few particular photos, so some of the current images are on twice.
  </li>
</ul>
